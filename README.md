# About

This is a research prototype of (a) an Enterprise Search Engine (C++) and (b) a Search Interface (Qt and Angular, d3). 


This repository contains the Enterprise Search Engine (back-end code).
Entire version of the prototype (part of my DPhil) is not open sourced. This code contains minimal comments and test cases.
Nevertheless, it can particulary be useful for learning, educational, and research purposes.


The search engine consists of following sub projects. 
 1. **Common**
 2. **Simulate-Data**     <-- Create a large-scale data/files to be searched
 3. **LanguageProcessor** <-- Search: WordNet reader  
 4. **Index**             <-- Index: to create, read, and update index (of files to be searched)
  1. **Index-Manager-Qt**
 5. **Ontology**          <-- Search: ontology modules to support knowledge-assisted search
  1. **Ontology-Manager**
 6. **Query-Processor**   <-- Search: receives query, search, rank, and returns
  1. **Query-Processor-NodeJsWrapper**
 7. **Search-Interface-Qt** <-- UI


# Common  

- Some common algorithms/functions being shared by all modules are implemented here. 
- The fileInfo (information related to a file (search result) data structure is also defined here.
 
	
## Compile and Test

We shall install this project-related deliverables (header files and libCommon.so) in `$HOME/install/`. 

- `cd Common`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug `
- `make`
- `make install`

Some basic test cases are available in `test` directory and run it. Note: add the libraries, e.g., libCommon.so, libtinyxml.so, etc in the LD_LIBRARY path

- `cd test`
- `ldd Test`  <-- check the dependent libraries
- `./Test`


# Simulate-Data
Generate simulated dataset (a file containing file metadata information) based on the statistics available in the `Simulate-Data/Stat` folder.

## Compile, Run, and Generate Simulated Data


- Read the `DataManager.pro` file and load the project in QtCreator or use 'qmake' tool to generate the binary `DataManager`.

- Run the` DataManager` binary (select Simulation -> input a number of simulated file metadata to be generated -> click Apply). 

- The generated statistics can be found in $HOME/install/stat/data.csv (can be set in the `DataManager.pro` file).

- In order to generate the statistics available in the `Simulate-Data/Stat` folder, run the` DataManager` binary (select Statistics -> click Apply).   

### Dependencies
Common project



# Language-Processor
	
## Compile and Test

We shall install this project-related deliverables (header files and libLanguageProcessor.so) in `$HOME/install/`. 

- `cd Language-Processor`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug `
- `make`
- `make install`
- `cd test`
- `ldd Test`  <-- check the dependent libraries
- `./Test`

### Dependencies
Common project


# Index

This is a enterprise search engine Inverted-Index code (minimal version based on Java Lucene). 
We shall install this project-related deliverables (header files and libIndex.so) in `$HOME/install/`. 

## Compile, Test, and Create Index

- `cd Index`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`
- `make`
- `make install`

Create an Index from the simulated dataset, even before runing a simple test to check if it is working.

### Check before creating Index
- Make sure the simulated data is available in the install path, here, $HOME/install/stat/Data.csv
- `mkdir $HOME/install/index` <-- index files will be created here using the file $HOME/install/stat/Data.csv

## Index-Manager-Qt : Create Index
- `cd Index-Manager-Qt`
- This is a very simple Qt prohject. Open the IndexManager.pro with QtCreator or use qmake.
- Generate a `IndexManager` binary 
- execute in QtCreator or `build/Indexmanager` (by default Simulation is selected and click OK, we are not using crawler).
- `ls $HOME/install/index`

`2.del  2.fdi  2.fdt  2.pro  2.tii  seg.fmn  segments` <-- the index files 

### Test to check if the inverted index is working

- `./Analyser/Test` <-- Will expect the inverted index in `$HOME/install/`

 

# Ontology

## Prerequisite : Sparksee graph database
The ontology is stored in a Sparksee graph database. This code is implemented using API version 5 / 5.2. Download it from [http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/#download](this link). The evaluation version only supports a limited number of nodes and edges.
Research licence is free.

I downloaded and copied the sparkesse header files, i.e., `sparksee/*/*.h` and library `libsparksee.so` in `$HOME/install` folder.
It can be anywhere as long as the paths are defined corrtly in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

## Compile

- `cd Ontology`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`
- `make; make install`

## Ontology-Manager : create or test ontologies
- `mkdir $HOME/install/gdb` <-- place where the database file will be created
- `./Ontology-Manager/Manager` <-- this file will create **fresh ontologies**, i.e., all the weights are set to dafualt value.

If you have a sparksee license then change the value `# define MAX_COUNT 150000` to support more nodes.
